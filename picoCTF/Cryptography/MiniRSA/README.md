# Mini RSA

## Challenge

### Description
What happens if you have a small exponent? There is a twist though, we padded the plaintext so that (M ** e) is just barely larger than N. Let's decrypt this: ciphertext

### Hints
1. RSA tutorial
2. How could having too small of an e affect the security of this key?
3. Make sure you don't lose precision, the numbers are pretty big (besides the e value)
4. You shouldn't have to make too many guesses
5. pico is in the flag, but not at the beginning
